#  II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION 
(...)
Successful CISE Research Infrastructure projects often:

* Provide infrastructure that enables research with a clear intellectual focus related to the CISE core disciplines that the three participating CISE divisions support. A clear research agenda that is enabled by the implementation of the infrastructure is the central element of a successful CRI project. In particular, each CRI project demonstrates a clearly focused research agenda associated with a group of research faculty with expertise in the particular CISE sub-disciplinary focus area.
* Involve participation by a group of CISE-focused researchers and leadership by CISE discipline researchers. Projects may enable other faculty and interdisciplinary groups, but clear CISE participation, involvement, and interest in the research is essential.
* Enable innovative CISE research that is not possible without the infrastructure and that support emerging CISE research frontiers.

While educational benefits and outreach to a diverse group of researchers are also desirable elements of successful projects, projects that do not enable CISE disciplinary research are not responsive to the CRI solicitation. **The primary motivations and outcomes from CRI funding must be related to potential research outcomes rather than potential educational benefits.**

(...)

Likewise, the past years have seen the emergence of a number of community resources and testbeds funded through CRI, NSF, and other sources to support CISE research. For example, cloud computing resources such as NSFFutureCloud as well as the collection of cloud resources now available beyond those supported by NSF offer excellent opportunities for investigations and data management that do not require significant additional infrastructure investments. **Researchers should first consider use of currently available resources before submitting a CRI proposal.** All CRI proposals must clearly demonstrate that the requirements of the proposed research agenda demand the new or enhanced infrastructure requested in the CRI proposal and cannot be accomplished using other existing resources. 



# Main text

For CI-NEW or CI-EN proposals, within the 15 pages allocated for the Project Description, describe the:

* Proposed CISE research infrastructure and its estimated lifetime, noting whether it is new infrastructure to be created and operated or existing infrastructure to be enhanced and operated;
* Compelling new CISE research opportunities enabled by the proposed infrastructure (including a description of the steps taken to identify the research opportunities enabled by the infrastructure as well as evidence that a diverse community of users plan to use the capabilities provided);
* CISE sub-disciplines that will benefit from the infrastructure and CISE-centric research groups within the participating institutions that will use the infrastructure;
* Existing related resources along with a justification that the proposed research cannot be accomplished with these resources at the institution or elsewhere;
* Samples of focused research projects or agendas that the infrastructure will enable (note that the novelty and innovative aspects of the research must be evident along with clear evidence that the proposed infrastructure is essential to moving CISE research frontiers forward);
* Quality of service commitment to the relevant CISE research community;
* Means by which user satisfaction will be evaluated and used to refine and improve subsequent infrastructure operations;
* Plans for outreach to ensure that a broad community of users is engaged;
* Community plans to provide long-term sustainability of the infrastructure;
* Qualifications of the PIs and the project team to manage the creation or enhancement and operations of the research infrastructure in support of its users; and
* Detailed project management plan, including a timeline, that outlines all steps to be undertaken to acquire, develop, and/or operate the research infrastructure, and identify the parties responsible for each major task; this plan should include a workplan that shows roles and responsibilities of each PI and Co-PI in establishing or enhancing the infrastructure associated with the CRI proposal.

If the proposed infrastructure is related to previously NSF-funded infrastructure, describe the extent to which the previously funded infrastructure will be integrated with the new infrastructure. Describe how funds remaining from earlier NSF grants for related infrastructure will be integrated with the requested award.


Proposers are reminded that, as specified in PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.d:

* **The Project Description must contain, as a separate section within the narrative, a section labeled “Broader Impacts.”** This section should provide a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities.
* Results from Prior NSF Support: If any PI or co-PI identified on the proposal has received NSF funding with a start date in the past five years (including any current funding and no-cost extensions), information on the award is required for each PI and co-PI, regardless of whether the support was directly related to the proposal. In cases where the PI or co-PI has received more than one award (excluding amendments), they need only report on the one award most closely related to the proposal. Funding includes not just salary support, but any funding awarded by NSF. Please refer to the PAPPG for details about the information that must be provided. Further requirements for this section of the proposal are in the PAPPG. **Note that these results from prior NSF support must be separately described under two distinct headings, “Intellectual Merit” and “Broader Impacts.”**

**Proposals without these two distinct sections within the Project Description may be returned without review.**
